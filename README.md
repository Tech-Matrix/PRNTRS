# 🖨 PRNTRS — An endeavour to connect, simplify and transform

<details>
  <summary> <strong>🏹The Motive</strong> </summary>
  <br>
PRNTRS is a web application which sends a document from customer to vendor by adding print slots and direct remote communication with the vendor thereby **eliminating long wait times**, **inefficiency and improving the safety of the customers** involved.

With the large influx of the rural and semi-urban population to sprawling metropolitan cities in the hopes of making their once-impossible aspirations a reality, comes the equally daunting challenge of connecting these tens of millions of Indians to the technology they deserve, but can’t dream to afford.
It has become increasingly clear over the past few decades that the gap between the urban affluent and the less-fortunate is ever-widening, and doesn’t look to be ceasing in the near future.

PRNTRS aims to simplify this process for working individuals, students and all those in between.
The onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to the world being hit with the novel concept of social distancing — a practice that both protects and frustrates. This has made long wait times even longer and more disorganized than ever.

This begs the question of how we can strive to make document uploading and printing a safer, faster and more convenient process for everyone — vendors and customers alike.

We looked to solve this predicament with PRNTRS by connecting the ubiquitous XEROX and Printing shops found across the city making it accessible to the user with a single click! What’s more, using the scheduling feature of our web-app, customers can now book their slots in advance from the shop of their choice — All from the comfort of their homes.
